Sometimes you are gonna have functions that you want to be used redundantly(over and over),
or maybe not only in the same program but in different programs. So instead of having to
write the function over and over again, what you can do is put all the functions you want
to reuse into its own separate file then include that file in whatever program you are 
working on.
